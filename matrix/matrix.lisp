; A list is a 1-D array of numbers.
; A matrix is a 2-D array of numbers, stored in row-major order.

; If needed, you may define helper functions here.

; AreAdjacent returns true iff a and b are adjacent in lst.

; Transpose returns the transpose of the 2D matrix mat.

; AreNeighbors returns true iff a and b are neighbors in the 2D
